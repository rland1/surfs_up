## Overview

I want to live and surf in Hawaii for the rest of my life and decided to open a surf and shake shop to fund it. I need investor backing for this plan to work out. Our investor is concerned about the weather in Oahu, and has asked us to perform data analysis to further the potential investment. 

## Results
- June has overall higher mean temp than December
- June has a higher max temp and min temp than December
- Overall June and December are similar in temperatures in Oahu, June's mean temp is 75, and December's is 71.

## Summary

Based on temperatures alone in June and December, I would recommend they open the surf shop considering they are warm and quite similar. Although they may need to analyze more data in order to get a full picture. 

### Additional Queries
- I would also pull in the precipitation data for these 2 months considering this is a part that the investor was worried about. 
- I would plot these two variables (temp & precipitation) on graphs to show their relationship and if we could infer anything about their likeliness of occuring every year.
